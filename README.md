Use Case:      Go to Amazon.com.      Search for "bose", which will show a page like this.      Inline image 1       Click on the first product that comes up. This will take you to a product page, that looks like this.      Inline image 2       Use the Share by email to send a mail to your gmail.      Inline image 3      Inline image 4       Login to your Gmail and verify if the right product information has been to your email. Use different techniques such as comparison of information present in the email versus what's present in the actual page to validate the information.      Inline image 5    Challenge:  For the use case that has been described above, create an automated test suite using the framework of your choice. If you can use a BDD enabled tool such as cucumber or Twist, that would be really great. If not, a direct implementation of the mechanics via Selenium or Sahi is also perfect. Consider using a source control system such as git to share your code.
